* to use the output from one resource in another, you put it like this; ${resource_type.resource_name.attribute} 

* you can explicitly make a resource depend on another resource by using the "depends_on = {}"

* terraform validate (used to validate the syntax of your cofig file)

* terraform fmt (used to format your config file to make it more readable)
